## 👋 About Me
Hi! I’m Swaminathan, a Ph.D. candidate at Texas A&M University who loves solving tough problems at the intersection of **optimization, machine learning, and systems engineering**.  
My research and projects are all about making complex systems smarter—whether it’s scaling up algae-based carbon capture, building predictive models, or designing clever algorithms to squeeze out better solutions.  
I enjoy blending rigorous math with real-world impact, and I like to keep things fun: if there’s a challenge that mixes modeling, coding, and creativity, I’m in.

## 🚀 Projects

- **Optimization Framework in Pyomo**  
  Developed large-scale nonlinear programming models for dynamic systems, enabling better design and decision-making under uncertainty.  

- **Vision Transformer (CIFAR-10)**  
  Built a deep learning model in PyTorch with advanced hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation, demonstrating the power of transformer architectures on image data.  

- **Yelp Review Classification**  
  Used Transformer-based NLP methods to classify thousands of reviews, achieving strong accuracy while exploring interpretability of embeddings.  

- **Vehicle Routing Metaheuristics**  
  Designed and implemented 2-opt, λ-interchange, and Iterated Local Search algorithms to solve capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRP).  

- **Particle Track Reconstruction**  
  Tackled a particle physics challenge by formulating track reconstruction as a QUBO optimization problem, experimenting with both simulated and quantum annealing approaches.
