## ðŸ“Œ About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Texas A&M University specializing in **optimization, machine learning, and algorithmic modeling**.  
My work focuses on **large-scale mathematical programming, nonlinear optimization, and deep learning**, applied to complex systems design and decision-making.  
I also have strong experience in **Pyomo, Gurobi, and Python-based frameworks** for solving real-world optimization and ML problems.
